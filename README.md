# Introduction 
## Description 
```
The Rabbithole Design is a personal portfolio built with Vue 3 (frontend) and Django (backend), structured as a monorepo 
for seamless integration. It features a retro aesthetic, Lucide icons, and a clean, modern design. This project serves as 
a showcase of my work in web development and design â€” feel free to explore!.
