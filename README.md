# Introduction 
## Description 
```
The Rabbithole Design is a full-stack developer portfolio that showcases both creative and 
technical skills through a custom-built web application. Designed with a unique retro aesthetic 
using Lucide icons, the project features a Vue 3 frontend and a Django backend, architected 
within a monorepo structure to streamline development and deployment.

This portfolio serves as both a personal brand site and a live demonstration of hands-on 
experience in modern web development, including API design, UI/UX, database integration, and 
cloud deployment.
```

## Key Features
```
Custom Design: Inspired by retro digital interfaces, built from scratch with Figma and translated 
into Vue components.
Full-Stack Architecture: A decoupled setup with RESTful API integration between the frontend 
(myrabbithole) and backend (wonderland).
Monorepo Structure: Organized and managed for efficient cross-project development and version control.
CMS-Driven: Content is dynamically served from the backend, allowing easy updates to portfolio 
items and blog posts.
Responsive Design: Mobile-first, pixel-perfect layout optimized across devices.
Deployment-Ready: Configured for deployment across modern hosting platforms, with support for 
database migrations and media storage.
