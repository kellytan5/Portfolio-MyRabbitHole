    'id': 1,
    'title': 'Portfolio', 
    'overview': 'To create a portfolio that reflects my visual style while demonstrating front-end architecture and basic back-end integration.',
    'problem': 'I wanted a portfolio that stood out visually while remaining readable and maintainable, without overengineering the back-end.',
    'approach': 'I chose Vue for its component structure and used a monorepo to keep front-end and back-end organized while developing locally.',
    'outcome': 'This project helped me better understand component reuse, project organization, and the tradeoffs between feature scope and maintainability.',
    'improvements': 'If I revisit this project, I would improve accessibility and refine state management as the project grows.',
    'role': 'Sole Designer and Developer',
    'scope': 'Front-end structure, visual design, and integration with a Django backend.',

    'id': 2,
    'title': 'Pinecone', 
    'overview': 'A university group project exploring LiDAR data processing concepts. My contribution focused on supporting the design phase by creating technical diagrams and documentation.',
    'problem': 'The team needed a clear shared understanding of a complex system involving LiDAR data processing, but the initial requirements and system structure were difficult to visualize.',
    'approach': 'I contributed by producing UML diagrams and structured documentation to represent system components, workflows, and relationships. I worked closely with teammates to ensure the documentation aligned with evolving requirements.',
    'outcome': 'The documentation helped establish a common reference point for the team and strengthened my ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear, maintainable visuals.',
    'improvements': 'If given more time, I would refine the diagrams iteratively as the system evolved and explore lightweight documentation tools that better integrate with development workflows.',
    'role': 'Software Engineer',
    'scope': 'UML diagram creation, technical documentation, and conceptual understanding of system overflows',

  {
    'id': 3,
    'title': 'Local Business Directory Application', 
    'overview': 'This project focused on improving application reliability through structured manual testing as part of a small academic team. Rather than building features, my role centred on identifying defects and clearly documenting them.',
    'problem': 'The application required testing to ensure core functionality worked as expected; however, no structured testing process was in place during early development.',
    'approach': 'I focused on manual testing by creating test cases based on the provided requirements. I executed these tests, documented defects with clear reproduction steps, and worked with team members to verify fixes once changes were made.',
    'outcome': 'The project improved my ability to think systematically about edge cases, communicate issues clearly, and understand how testing contributes to overall software quality.',
    'improvements': 'I would explore basic test automation and improve test coverage by expanding edge-case scenarios.',
    'role': 'Quality Assurance Tester',
    'scope': 'Manual testing and defect documentation',
